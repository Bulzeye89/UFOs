# UFOs

## Overview 
### Background
Dana has provided data surrounding UFO sightings in a JavaScript array.  With this, a webpage with a dynamic table was built where users were able to filter the data by date.  Dana is now looking to provide users to filter using multiple criteria at the same time.  She believes this will help provide a more in-depth analysis for them and wishes to use city, state, country, and shape as the additional filters.  

### Resources
-Data Source: [data.js](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/UFOs/blob/main/Static/js/data.js)<br>
-Software: Visual Studio Code version 1.68.1, Javascript, HTML

## Results
The website is up and running and the additional filters have been added.  We have removed the "filter" button.  The below screenshot shows the initial look users will see and they can choose what filters to use.

## Summary: 
Based on the findings of this initial analysis, my business recommendations would be to placing a cap on number of drivers or setting limits on how often drivers have to be active to remain eligible to drive for PyBer depending on the city type.  The data that was analyzed for this project has 1,625 total urban rides and 2,405 total urban drivers.  Urban markets may be oversaturated with drivers and it is worth looking into how 780 drivers didn't even have 1 total ride driven.  Adding more drivers to both suburban and rural areas could be lucrative as these types of cities typically have less elaborate public transport system.  It's possible that more total rides could be given if more drivers were available.  Further analysis that could be considered to find ideal number of drivers per city would be to look at population counts of cities as well as filtering the date/timestamp of the rides to find peak service times.  With this data, PyBer could become more control the number of drivers hired as well as the availability of those hired drivers to drive maximum revenue.

# UFOs

## Overview 
### Background
Dana has provided data surrounding UFO sightings in a JavaScript array.  With this, a webpage with a dynamic table was built where users were able to filter the data by date.  Dana is now looking to provide users to filter using multiple criteria at the same time.  She believes this will help provide a more in-depth analysis for them and wishes to use city, state, country, and shape as the additional filters.  

### Resources
-Data Source: [data.js](https://github.com/Bulzeye89/UFOs/blob/main/Static/js/data.js)<br>
-Software: Visual Studio Code version 1.68.1, Javascript, HTML

## Results
The website is up and running and the additional filters have been added.  We have removed the "filter" button and users will see placeholders in the five different fields that can be used to analyze the data.

</p>  
Users will be able to type in one of the fields and press enter, which will prompt the data table to update.  From here users, can further filter the results by typing into the four remaining fields.  If they wish to remove a filter, they can simply delete the input and press enter.  Below is an example of a search by filtering the state as "fl" and the shape as "fireball"

Here is another example where the data table is filtered with the state as "ca" and the date as "1/4/2010"
